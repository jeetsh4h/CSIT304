Line Drawing Algorithm 

Know the derivation of the Bresenham's Algorithm
- for both m > 1 and m <= 1


3-D to 2-D projection is essentially dimensionality reduction
using your eyes is essentially projection


the axes are translated in such a way that the transformation about a point P, turns into translation about origin
essentially apply a translation to every point in such a way that the point P can be treated as the origin

Therefore, you perform negative translation (essentially translate everything to -P) and then the X trabsformation and 
then translate it back.



In this class we are assuming that all vectors are represented as a column vector
Thereore, when multiply the trabsformation matrices, make sure that the first transformation step is on the
most righthand side part
